# stm32f7-rtc
This is a RTC driver for the STM32F7xx family of controllers.

## Version
* 0.6 (27 May 2017)

## License
* MIT

## Package
The driver is provided as an _xpack_ and can be installed in an Eclipse based project using the attached script (however, the include and source paths must be manually added to the project in Eclipse). For more details on _xpacks_ see https://github.com/xpacks. The installation script requires the helper scripts that can be found at https://github.com/xpacks/scripts.

## Dependencies
The driver depends on the following software packages, all available as _xpacks_:
* STM32F7 CMSIS (https://github.com/xpacks/stm32f7-cmsis)
* STM32F7xx HAL Library (https://github.com/xpacks/stm32f7-hal)
* uOS++ (https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus-iii)

Note that the hardware initialisations (uController clock, peripherals clocks, etc.) must be separately performed, normaly in, or called from the initialize_hardware.c file of a gnuarmeclipse project. You can do this using the CubeMX generator from ST. You may find helpful to check the following projects as references:
* https://github.com/micro-os-plus/eclipse-demo-projects/tree/master/f746gdiscovery-blinky-micro-os-plus
* https://github.com/micro-os-plus/eclipse-demo-projects/tree/master/f746gdiscovery-blinky-micro-os-plus/cube-mx which details how to integrate the CubeMX generated code into a uOS++ based project.

The driver was designed for the ÂµOS++ ecosystem, but it can be easily ported to other RTOSes, as it uses only a mutex.

## Time Zone
The driver assumes that all date/time information is UTC (the time_t datatype refers to UTC). This might be a problem when setting the alarms, as they +must+ be also reference to UTC. For recurring alarms set at intervals defined only in seconds and minutes this is not an issue. However, if hours, days, months are used to define alarms, then the data in the tm structure must be converted to UTC.

The time zone in your application should be set using the setenv () and tzset () functions. Then all standard time functions would properly operate (localtime, gmtime, mktime, etc.). The integration to your system should be made using the gettimeofday () and settimeofday () syscall functions. For uOS++ this will follow soon.

## Tests
There is a test that must be run on a real target. For the time being, the test is doing the following:
* Initializes the RTC
* Optionally sets the date and time (especially useful if the hardware includes a battery backup)
* Sets two alarms

This is work in progress, more to come.
